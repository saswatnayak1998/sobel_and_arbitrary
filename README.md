# Poly Interview Questions

Thanks for your interest in Poly! We're excited to get to know more about you. This take-home kit is designed to help you showcase your skills in a much more thoughtful setting than a stressful real-time programming interview. These questions are designed to take a few hours. While we can't compensate you for the time you spend answering these questions, we hope that the experience of doing these problems is informative and educational. If not, we welcome any feedback on the interview process (which you can send alongside, or in lieu of, your code submission).

## Instructions & Environment Setup

1. Clone (don't fork!) this library to your local system and create a new repo under your own name. This will allow you to submit your work by sharing your repo address and we can simply set one of our remotes to your repo to inspect your code against ours. However, forking this repo will make your answers visible to other candidates, so please don't do that.
2. Open the repo in your editor of choice (we _highly_ recommend Visual Studio Code)
3. You only need to answer the question(s) relating to the skill set you have. You can of course look at any problem but you shouldn't feel required to address other questions. 
4. Look at the readme in that question in order to get more specific instructions
5. Place any build/run code in the folder with the README, and provide us with some instructions on how to dive into your code.

## Rubric and Success Criteria

Our primary goal is to give you the opportunity to show off your skills. If you are good at something, e.g. a particular library, threading, async, numpy jujitsu, etc. you have the opportunity to show it off in the context of your interview question. More specifically, here's how we evaluate your code:

1. **Did you understand the "hard part" of the problem and craft a succinct solution?** We want to know if you have the ability to find clever and functional solutions to hard problems. We are not interested in whether your code is optimized beyond broad O(n) considerations. So optimizing for number of lines of code, etc. is not meaningful to us. You can always add comments to help explain what optimizations you left out for time's sake
2. **Does your code exhibit high quality and logical structure?** Did you adhere to abstractions? Do your classes make logical sense? Did you use good programming patterns?
3. **Can we verify your solution?** Does the code run, or compile? Instructions do not need to be extreme, just some way to wrap our heads around what you've done.

## Stuff that doesn't matter

1. Writing unit tests
2. Fully-type hinted code
3. Complete analysis, charts, ablations, etc.

## Interview Questions

Please see the individual folders for questions

## Submitting your result

You can e-mail us at [work@withpoly.com](mailto:work@withpoly.com) with a link to your repo. We are looking for more elegant ways to privately share your results without using e-mail (e.g. GitHub pull requests).

## Asking for clarification

If you have any clarifying questions about your interview prompt or the interview process, feel free to open a github issue and I will try to address the question there.
